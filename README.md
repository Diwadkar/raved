RAVED - Reproducible Analysis and Validation of Expression Data
======


Authors: Mengyuan Kan, Maya Shumyatcher, Blanca Himes

This pipeline written in two R Markdown scripts was initially developed for reproducible analysis of microarray dataset from GEO, including the following:
* Raw intensity data download
* Phenotype file preparation
* Quality control (QC)
* Comparison assignment
* Differential expression (DE) analysis 

Several freely accessible R packages for microarray data analysis are used in this pipeline. We provide two template.Rmd for QC and DE analysis.
